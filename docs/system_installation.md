# System Installation

If you haven't installed Arch Linux yet, continue reading. Otherwise, you
might want to skip to the [configuration](./configuration.md) step.

I recommend that you read the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
instead since it is more updated and accurate than a guide that is maintained
by one hobbyist like me. I also recommend reading
[arch.d3sox.me](https://arch.d3sox.me/) if you have trouble understanding the
wiki.
