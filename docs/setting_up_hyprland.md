# Setting Up Hyprland

To start customizing Hyprland, just copy the dotfiles to `~/.config/`. Running
Hyprland at this time is not yet recommended since we haven't customized the
rest of the programs yet.

```bash
cp -r ./dotfiles/hypr ~/.config/hypr
```

> **NOTE**: If you are having problems with Hyprland, see their
> [wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Crashes-and-Bugs/).
