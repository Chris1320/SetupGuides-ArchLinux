# Setting Up SDDM

1. Enable the SDDM service to start the display manager on boot.
2. Copy the SDDM configuration file and catppuccin theme configuration to their
   designated locations.

```bash
systemctl enable sddm.service
sudo cp -r ./dotfiles/sddm/sddm.conf /etc/sddm.conf.d/sddm.conf
```

> **NOTE**: Make sure that git submodules are pulled before attempting to copy
> the files from `./dotfiles/sddm/sddm-catppuccin-theme` directory.
>
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
> ```
