      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This repository contains most of my dotfiles and notes that are used in
        my Arch Linux installation. You can use the
        <a href="./docs/automatic_installation.md">auto-install script</a>
        to automatically install Arch Linux and the dotfiles in your system.
        However, I don't guarantee that the installer covers all your needs. In
        such cases (or you probably do not want to start from scratch), this
        guide assumes that...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You've successfully installed Arch Linux by following their
          <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide"
            >installation guide</a
          >
          which can be found in their
          <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">wiki</a>. I also recommend
          reading <a href="https://arch.d3sox.me/">arch.d3sox.me</a> if you have
          trouble understanding the wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have made a
          <a href="#setting-up-a-non-root-user">non-root user</a> in your system
          and is currently active.
        </li>
        <li>You are currently connected to the internet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some, if not all of the dotfiles, can also be used in other operating
        systems/distributions, but it's up to you on how you will do it since I
        haven't tested it on other systems yet.
      </p>

        <b>NOTE</b>: This page is currently under active development.
        Documentation might be outdated because the dotfiles/scripts are updated
        frequently.
