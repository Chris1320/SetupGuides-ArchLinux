## Description

This repository contains most of my dotfiles and notes that are used in
my Arch Linux installation. You can use the
[auto-install script](./docs/automatic_customization.md)
to automatically install Arch Linux and the dotfiles in your system.
However, I don't guarantee that the installer covers all your needs. In
such cases (or you probably do not want to start from scratch), this
guide assumes that...

- You've successfully installed Arch Linux by following their
  [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)
  which can be found in their [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).
  Otherwise, follow the
  [system installation guide](./docs/system_installation.md) before
  proceeding.
- You have made a [non-root user](./docs/system_installation.md#add-a-non-root-user-account)
  in your system and is currently active.
- You are currently connected to the internet.

Some, if not all of the dotfiles, can also be used in other operating
systems/distributions, but it's up to you on how you will do it since I
haven't tested it on other systems yet.

> **NOTE**: This guide is currently under active development.
> Documentation might be outdated because the dotfiles/scripts are updated
> frequently.
